    <h1>Abdirisaq introduction</h1>
    <h2>My story</h2>
    <h3>I’m a software engineering student based in the UK who’s just started learning web development, beginning with HTML. I’m excited about building websites and apps, and I enjoy learning step by step as I grow my skills. As I progress, I plan to expand into CSS and JavaScript, then move into tools and frameworks like Git, React, TypeScript, and Next.js. My goal is to create clean, user-friendly digital experiences while improving with each project.</h3>
